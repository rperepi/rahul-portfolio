Rahul Perepi

Hey, I'm Rahul Perepi. 

Architecting the entire data lifecycle. I’ve spent my career wearing three hats: the Engineer who builds the foundation, the Analyst who finds the story, and the ML Engineer who predicts the sequel. I turn complex datasets into scalable, automated solutions that solve real-world problems.
